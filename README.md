# [Building Systems with the ChatGPT API](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/building-systems-with-chatgpt/)
In Building Systems With The ChatGPT API, you will learn how to automate complex workflows using chain calls to a large language model. Unlock new development capabilities and improve your efficiency in this brand new short course.

You’ll build:

- Chains of prompts that interact with the completions of prior prompts.
- Systems where Python code interacts with both completions and new prompts.
- A customer service chatbot using all the techniques from this course.

You’ll learn how to apply these skills to practical scenarios, including classifying user queries to a chat agent’s response, evaluating user queries for safety, and processing tasks for chain-of-thought, multi-step reasoning. 

This one-hour course, taught by Isa Fulford (OpenAI) and Andrew Ng (DeepLearning.AI), builds on the lessons taught in the popular [ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/), though it is not a prerequisite. 

Hands-on examples make each concept easy to understand. Built-in Jupyter notebooks allow you to seamlessly experiment with the code and prompts presented in the course.
